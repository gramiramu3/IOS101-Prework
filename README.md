## Notes

While building the app, one challenge was understanding how to properly use IBOutlets and IBActions within the Storyboard and connect them to the Swift code using the Assistant Editor in Xcode. It also took some trial and error to implement features like dynamically changing the background color, adjusting brightness with a slider, and updating text color in real time. Ensuring proper layout with Auto Layout constraints across different screen sizes required additional fine-tuning. Overall, these challenges provided valuable hands-on experience with UIKit and Xcode’s interface builder.
